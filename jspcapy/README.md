# jspcapy

&nbsp;

 > This program is derived from `jspcap` and `jsformat`.

&emsp; `jspcapy` is a **command line** pcap file analyser tool. It supports analysis on several networking protocol headers, such as `IP` (both version 4 and 6), `ICMP`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `SCTP`, et al and streaming output of `plist`, `json` and *tree-view* text file.

 > &emsp; In the core of the `JSPCAP` project, it works with the support of  `jspcap` and `jsformat`, which can both be found in three projects above and are maintained in the [`dev`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/dev/) branch.

&emsp; Notice that the whole project is developed in `Python 3.6` and its compatibility hasn't been tested.
