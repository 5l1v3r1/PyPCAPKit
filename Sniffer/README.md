# Sniffer

&nbsp;

 > This program is the assignment of Computer Networking (SJTU).

&emsp; `Sniffer` is a `wxPython` based sniffer application.

 > &emsp; In the core of the `Sniffer` program, it works with the support of `jspcap` and `jsformat`, which can both be found in three projects above and are maintained in the [`dev`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/master/dev/) folder.

&emsp; Notice that the whole program is developed in `Python 3.6` and its compatibility hasn't been tested.
