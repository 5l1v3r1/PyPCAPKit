# JSPCAP

 > This repo is derived from assignments of Python 101 & Computer Networking (SJTU).

&emsp; The `JSPCAP` project is an open source `Python3` program focus on [PCAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap) parsing and analysis, which includes three different independent projects:

 - [`jspcapy`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/master/jspcapy) -- A **command line** pcap file analyser tool

 - [`Sniffer`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/master/Sniffer) -- A `wxPython` based sniffer application

 - [`TreeViewer`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/master/TreeViewer) -- A `Tkinter` based pcap extractor application

In the core of the `JSPCAP` project, it works with the support of  `jspcap` and `jsformat`, which can both be found in three projects above and are maintained in the [`dev`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcap/tree/dev/) branch.

&emsp; Notice that the whole project is developed in `Python 3.6` and its compatibility hasn't been tested.
